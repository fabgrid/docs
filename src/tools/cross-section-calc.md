title: Cross-section Calculator
layout: default
---

This tool is to calculate the required cross-section of the conductors. Based on the **currency**, **output power** and **resistivity** of the conductor, the cross-section area required to meet a **desired power dissipation** per meter can be calculated.

## Input Parameters

### Currency

The currency (voltage) at which the system works. Make separate calculations for all rails or adjust their maximum power spec accordingly.

### Output Power

The total power your system should be capable of delivering.

### Resistivity

This constant describes the resistance of your conductor in <math><mfrac><mrow><mi>Ω</mi><mo>×</mo><msup><mi>mm</mi><mn>2</mn></msup></mrow><mrow><mi>m</mi></mrow></mfrac></math>
