## License

I'm a fan of permissive licenses – who is the "originator" of anything, anyway? All comes from…

… well let's not get philosophic here. The stuff we put online is there to be used by others, right? If anyone makes a profit from it – cool! I'd propably do so too, if i weren't to busy with my own business.

As "public domain" is no accepted **license** – and CC0 carries "CC" in its name – **i choose the following licenses for everything on this website that i have the right to define the licensing terms for (that is, everything that i'm the "originator" of): [MIT License](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html)**

Yes, there are licenses better suited for software source code, and others for artwork, etc… But… everything that can be tracked by git is "software" by some definition. Furthermore, the MIT license is merely a disclaimer text that denies any liability for what other people do with this stuff. And that, at least, won't hurt in a world full of laws and attorneys. So there really is not much "license" in the MIT license – it basically allows everything, except for sueing the author if you mess things up.
