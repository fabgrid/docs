## Student Reviews:

- When laser-cutting: Don't go too slow, rather to more passes
- Plants hydrated with fog (Albot Dima @ Kamp-Lintfort): http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2017/fablabkamplintfort/students/396/final.html#final

## Electronics Production

- Step down by the copper thickness when the endmill gets dull, to use a different section of the mill and have good results again
- Use FR-1 because FR-4 will kill the mill much quicker
- Be careful about reflowing FR-1
- ~ 100$ for making boards at a board house based on n_layers, turnaround time
- Make batches <= 10 yourself, bigger quantities externally
- They also do components placing and soldering
- Design Rules
	- How close can traces be?
	- How thin can traces be?
	- Layers
	- 1.5-sided boards = One-sided board with crossovers
- Parts search engine: [http://octopart.com/](http://octopart.com/)
- Solder Joints: shiny and smooth
- Solder bottom to top and inside out
