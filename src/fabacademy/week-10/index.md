I have some spare [V-Slot](http://openbuildspartstore.com/v-slot-20x40-linear-rail/) linear extrusions along with accessories. Let's use them to build a simple pen plotter. It could later be rebuilt into a general purpose 2.5-3 axis CNC machine, which would likely require a more rigid design in most cases.

## Design
Currently, i'm thinking of a simple "T" style design with only one linear actuator per axis. As we're not building a heavy-duty CNC machine, but rather just a plotter, forces should be small enough to allow for that kind of setup.

### Parts Library
The design is developed around the V-Slot extrusions, so using the [Openbuilds OpenSCAD library](https://github.com/mazerte/openscad-openbuilds) can save us some time.

A quick test to see if it's working:

</div>

### Process
1. Design a common linear actuator
2. Design the Y-axis
3. Design the X-axis
4. Design the Z-axis (end effector)
5. Assemble everything
6. Animate

#### Linear actuator
A linear actuator consists of:

- a length of extrusion
- a "passive end" with the idler pulley
- an "active end" with the stepper motor
- the gantry
- the belt (maybe omit that from the CAD)

The motor stems from the `MCAD` library, which is bundeled with OpenSCAD. The pulleys are included in `openscad-openbuilds`. I couldn't find a model of the *end mount* for the motor and idler pulley, so i designed it myself. I likely would have needed that custom model anyway, because i want to print them, instead of buying them for 10â‚¬ each.

#### X and Y axis
After modelling the linear actuator, "assembling the axes" is quite simple: Just put two of them on top of each other:

The X motor kind of acts as a counterweight

#### End effector
The end effector (Z axis) will slide on cheap 8mm smooth rod with LM8UU linear bearings. It will push the pen downwards using a spring and be able to lift it with a servo. The assembly could be mounted upside down to inverse this logic so that the pen would be pushed **up** by the spring and **down** by the servo. I prefer the former approach because this way the spring acts as a suspension while drawing, smoothing out any irregularities in the drawing surface and reducing forces at the pen tip.

## Build Steps
Building with Openbuilds parts is quite straight forward and requires not much explanation:

## Individual Contribution
Though this assignment is a group assignment (and requires to describe the individual's contribution), i did the design and build by myself, as i didn't find the time to visit to the lab and coordinate with the other student.

## Improvements
- Add end stops
- Smarter pen holder
- Increase counterweight or add wheel to the loose end of the X axis
- Use thinner rod for the end effector 4 or 6mm (8mm is what i happened to have around)
