## Applications & Implications

### What will it do?

A color- and brightness-adjustable LED-lamp that imitates sunlight during the course of the day. It oscillates between warm (~2500K) and cold (~5000K) white, synced with the sun, based on its location. Features a smartphone app.

### Who's done what beforehand?

I've done a small experiment in that direction about two years ago, using a pre-made Arduino, pre-made LED modules  and PT4115E driver boards.

### What materials and components will be required? / Where will they come from?

- [Electronics]({{ site.baseurl }}/illuminative/electronics.html) (lab stock / farnell)
	- + external wall adapter (24V 2A) (lab stock)
- Copper sheet for the heat sink (lab stock)
- Housing
	- Glass pipe (local glass blower)
	- Composite (raw materials from lab stock)

### How much will it cost?


### What parts and systems will be made?

- **LED modules** – arrays of two different types of LEDs, separately controllable
- **Controller Board** - based on ATMega328 / [I²DC]({{ site.baseurl }}/i2dc/index.html) two filtered PWM channels, serial bluetooth interface
- **Housing** – Glass pipe + end caps
- **Physical UI**
- **Android App**

### What processes will be used?

- PCB Milling
- Reflow Soldering
- CNC Milling
- Composites
- 3D Printing

### What tasks need to be completed?


### What questions need to be answered?


### What is the schedule?
