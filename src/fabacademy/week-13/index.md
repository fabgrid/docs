## CAD

First, i need to create a digital design of the dial wheel with the following specs:

- 50mm outer diameter
- 8mm thickness
- knurled rim
- center hole to mount it on the shaft of the rotary encoder

### Steps

1. Design "positive" model of the dial wheel
2. Add cast-on sections
3. Subtract from a solid to get the negative model
4. Split result into two halves
5. Add notches/holes for proper alignment of the two halves

### Execution

<div class="row">

	<div class="col-md-6"><zoom src="02-cast-ons.png" caption="â€¦ with 'cast-ons'"></zoom></div>
</div>
