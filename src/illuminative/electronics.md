# Requirements

- Total of 1500 - 2000 lumen of luminous flux
- Two-channel PWM drive
- Current monitor per channel
- Bluetooth interface

# PCB Material

The PCB for the driver circuit will be on a regular 2-sided Expoxy base material. The LED arrays themselves are going to be milled from aluminium base material, allowing lots of thermal energy to transit.

# Parts Choice

## LEDs

- High CRi
- Binned so we can drive them in parallel (ideally)

Cold: http://www.nichia.co.jp/specification/products/led_spec/NSSWT02AT-V2-E(4368A)R8000%20R90.pdf
Warm: http://www.nichia.co.jp/specification/products/led_spec/NSSLT02AT-V2-E(4371A)R8000%20R90.pdf

## Drivers

- 2 channels
- 0-1A / 24V per channel
- Settable current

So as described below, a voltage controlled constant current sink will be used to drive the LEDs throug an op-amp/mosfet combination. The op-amp is configured in a way that the current on the output matches the voltage on the input. This is achieved by connecting the output to GND via a known value resistor. If this resistor is 1Ω, the output current will equal 1A if the input voltage is 1V.

### Low pass filter

A 2-stage RC low-pass filter is between the µC and the opamp's input. I choose 2x (2kΩ and 1µF) in series, which gives quite a smooth DC @244Hz, 50% duty cycle. Another µF is added at the opamp's output. The simulation (link below) shows that our resulting output current has a ripple of roughly ±10mA. I hope that is small enough to not be noticable on the LEDs.

### Voltage divider

As our target current range is 0-1A, we need a 1/5 voltage divider to convert our µC's 5V (@ 100% PWM duty cycle) signal to a 1V opamp input, which should yield a 1A constant output. Our filter already adds 4kΩ of series resistance. Adding another 5.9k in series and 2.49k to ground gives us the following divider ratio:

(4k+5.9k+2.49k) / 2.49k = 4.9759036145

That's close enough to our 1/5 target ratio, as we don't need an exactly know current. We only need to know the maximum current fairly exactly and need to control it linearly.

## Bluetooth Adapter

## Microcontroller

- 2-4 ADC channels
- Serial port (for bluetooth adapter)
- 2 hi-res PWM channels

### Brightness steps

The problem with our standard 8-bit PWM is that those steps are linearly spaced. 256 steps would be enough for our eye to notice no discrete steps, if only they were spaced logarithmically. Our eye's perception of brightness is approximately logarithmic. This means doubling the perceived brightness requires four times the light. So at the lower end of the duty cycle, we're gonna have too big increments in order to dim without noticable steps, while at the upper end the increments could be way bigger without us noticing any jumps in brightness.

So what's the solution? Logarithmic PWM, right? No idea if that exists – i've never heard of it. Instead, we can increase the resolution of our PWM to a lot more steps, and then choose a tiny subset of logarithmically-spaced duty cycle values. Assuming our LEDs have a near-linear power-to-brighness curve, looping through that subset should give us almost linear dimming.

These lookup tables for different bit depths, created by the fine guys at mikrocontroller.net forum, should illustrate what i'm saying:

#### Resolution vs. Clock frequency

Timer1 on the 328 has 16 bit and two output compare registers. We can use that to drive two PWM outputs with up to 16 bit resolution (0-65535). But – and here's the next issue – this would reduce out PWM *frequency* to <math><mfrac><mrow><mn>16</mn><mi>MHz</mi></mrow><mrow><msup><mn>2</mn><mn>16</mn></msup></mrow></mfrac><mo>≈</mo><mn>244</mn><mi>Hz</mi></math>. That would require huge filter components after the MOSFETs.

So we have to do some sort of trade-off between switching frequency and resolution. Also, increasing the clock frequency would help. We could run the Mega328 at 20MHz or even swap it for an XMega, which runs at 32MHz. If we don't want to fall below, say 2kHz switching frequency, with a 32MHz clock, the resolution would be <math><mfrac><mrow><mn>32</mn><mi>MHz</mi></mrow><mrow><mn>2</mn><mi>kHz</mi></mrow></mfrac><mo>=</mo><mn>16000</mn><mo>≈</mo><msup><mn>2</mn><mn>14</mn></msup></math>. 14 bit – let's go with that for the beginning…

##### Better solution:

I found a nice circuit called the *Voltage Controlled Current Sink*. It uses an opamp to generate a constant current through a ground resistor from a control voltage. The advantage is that there's no need to filter the high current signal after the MOSFET, but only the small control voltage. This lets me use a much smaller filter circuit between the µC and the opamp.

An [online simulator](http://www.falstad.com/circuit/) helps me to validate the circuit before bulding it:
