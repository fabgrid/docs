The fabgrid is my final project for the FabAcademy '17. [FabAcademy](http://fabacademy.org/) is a course on "How to make anything" - focussing on digital fabrication. It is held every year by [Neil Gershenfeld at the MIT](http://ng.cba.mit.edu/) with the support of local instructors in [FabLabs around the world](https://fablabs.io).

Within a couple of weeks we're going to acquire all kinds of digital fabrictation skills, including cnc cutting and milling, 3D printing, electronics design, programming and more. For a full list of all lessons, check the *FabAcademy Schedule* link below.

I will try to use each lesson to create a necessary part to my final project, the fabgrid. One of the most interesting parts will be *Molding and Casting*, as i've never done it before.
