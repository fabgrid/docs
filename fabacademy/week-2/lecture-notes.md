## Student Reviews:

- Microphones far in the corners of a glass window can used to calculate the position of an interaction with the window based on the time the signal takes to reach each microphone. Piezo microphones work fine.
- [Tim Rolls](http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2017/makerlabs/students/384/about.html) does generative art, which interests me, i'll check it out…
- There is material online on designing with cnc machines interactively
- [Lucio Pentagna](http://archive.fabacademy.org/archives/2017/farmlabalgarve/students/290/project01.html) builds a vending machine - @andy

## 2D Design:

- There is a fork of imagemagick: [http://www.graphicsmagick.org/](http://www.graphicsmagick.org/)
- Nice hand-drawn circuit: [http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.15/section.CBA/people/Schaad/week6-electronics-design.html](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.15/section.CBA/people/Schaad/week6-electronics-design.html)
- Inkscape can "clone" objects (same as symbols in Sketch)
- FreeCAD can handle constraints in 2D

## 3D Design:

- Blender has something like grasshopper: [http://nikitron.cc.ua/sverchok_en.html](http://nikitron.cc.ua/sverchok_en.html)
- Custom CAM solution for Rhino: [https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/Bark-beetle-parametric-toolpaths](https://github.com/fellesverkstedet/Bark-beetle-parametric-toolpaths)
- FreeCAD also supports "clones", can act non-destructive, and features "Spreadsheets" to define variables / parameters
- Autodesk products are free for Fablabs
- Solidworks is good for big projects, meaning complex or many people working on
- Onshape is a higher-end browser/cloud based 3D design software
- Check antimony for its parametricity
- Simulation Solidworks and Autodesk have simulation built-in
- Antimony + OpenSCAD = [http://graphscad.blogspot.de/](http://graphscad.blogspot.de/)
