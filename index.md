		<p><strong>Low-voltage DC power grid to supply today's devices with power at the voltage they need.</strong></p>
		<p>One or a few central power supply units provide 5V, 12V, and 24V which are made available throughout the entire faciliy via surface-mounted wiring. Different types of outlets can provide any other (low) DC voltage and some extra features like monitoring, protection, or regulation.</p>
		<h2>Why fabgrid?</h2>
		<blockquote>When all outlets are occupied with power adapters, aren't we just using the wrong power grid?</blockquote>
		<p>Many devices that we use daily need a power adapter in order to operate on AC current at 110 or 230 V, as typically provided by the outlets installed in our houses. This project is meant to develop a system for creating a paralell, low-voltage DC-power grid with respect to the requirements and capabilities of a fablab. Yet, the system is intended to be used in homes and other professional enviroments equally.</p>
